# Monte Carlo Assignment

This repository contains Python code for the Monte Carlo assignment. You can use this code to perform Monte Carlo simulations. This README provides step-by-step instructions on how to access and use the file via the terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before using this code, you need to have the following installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.x, tested with python3.11)
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you have Git installed, open your terminal and run the following command to clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/souptikm4/monte-carlo-assignment.git
```

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the repository as a ZIP file from the GitHub page and extract it to your desired location.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd monte-carlo-assignment
```

### 3. Install Dependencies (if required)

A common way to manage dependencies is to create a virtual environment:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment (on Windows)
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate the virtual environment (on macOS and Linux)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required packages
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

### 4. Run the Simulation

```bash
python monte_carlo_assignment.py 
python monte-with-changes.py
```

### 5. View the Results

After running the script, you can view the results or generated output in the terminal.
